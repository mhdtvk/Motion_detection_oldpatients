# Motion_detection_oldpatients

This project captures a patient's video and detects their movements, displaying them on the video. Our criterion for measuring the person's movement is the area of the moving parts, which is shown on the video. A threshold for the amount of movement can be set, and if the movement exceeds this threshold, the program will notify us. Additionally, there is an option to enable breathing detection, which specifically focuses on the patient's breathing pattern and detects their respiratory rhythm.

There is also a report generation feature available, allowing you to create a chart of movement over time for each video and a detailed report of the movement detected in each frame.

For more information, feel free to contact us.
